## Disclaimer
Resulting code was written while interpreting L-systems and playing around. I don't expect it's correct 
implementation, but main goal is to see interesting pictures.

## Usage
- open ```form.php``` in browser
- experiment with settings
- submit form

OR

- use ```main.php``` in terminal and pipe results to image file, for example `php main.php > image.gif`

> note:
for now there is no error handling and high parameter values could lead to issues with getting any result or getting result in timely fashion
